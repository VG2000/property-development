          North Wales stretches from the English border at Wrexham and Flintshire along the A55 corridor to the ferry port at Holyhead on Anglesey (Ynys Môn), and south into Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park. The region is effectively two economies. To the east, Wrexham–Deeside behaves like a spillover of the Liverpool–Manchester–Chester city region: good road/rail connectivity, large employment parks, and a steady commuter base. To the west, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, and Anglesey are defined by coastal towns, rural villages, tourism, and a growing clean-energy footprint tied to the Irish Sea.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800">Demographics &amp; Communities</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Population centres include Wrexham (city status since 2022), the coastal arc of Rhyl–Colwyn Bay–Llandudno–Conwy, the university town of Bangor, and Holyhead. Demographically, the east skews working-age with industrial and logistics jobs; the west has an older profile in many coastal and rural communities, balanced by students in Bangor and younger households in larger resorts. Welsh language use is a distinctive factor—particularly strong in Gwynedd and Anglesey—so community engagement and branding that respect bilingual norms can matter.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800">Transport &amp; Infrastructure</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Transport is a strength. The A55 expressway links to the M56 for Manchester Airport and the wider motorway network. Rail runs Holyhead–Chester–London Euston. Holyhead is a major Ireland–UK gateway; ports at Mostyn and Holyhead support offshore wind operations. Bangor University and the Menai Science Park (M-SParc) anchor research and innovation, especially in marine, environmental, and digital sectors.
